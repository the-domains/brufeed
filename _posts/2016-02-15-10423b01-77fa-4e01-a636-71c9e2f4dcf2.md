![Taken over the #weekend in #DesolationWilderness. At the #summit of #MtRalston in the #Sierras at an #elevation of 9300 feet, #CanInHandMan @Nevo08 riskily hung a limb out over the edge of the #cliff for this shot, but come #HellOrHighWatermelon, that's what he was going to do! No better way to enjoy a cold @21stAmendment #watermelon infused #wheatbeer than to share one up here in #godscountry. Well done sir! #Br√ºfeed](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4f26027be01619e8ad4f7e85b4c9dc9bee189452.jpg)
