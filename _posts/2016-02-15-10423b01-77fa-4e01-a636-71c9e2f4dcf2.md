Taken over the \#weekend in \#DesolationWilderness. At the \#summit of \#MtRalston in the \#Sierras at an \#elevation of 9300 feet, \#CanInHandMan @Nevo08 riskily hung a limb out over the edge of the \#cliff for this shot, but come \#HellOrHighWatermelon, that's what he was going to do! No better way to enjoy a cold @21stAmendment \#watermelon infused \#wheatbeer than to share one up here in \#godscountry. Well done sir! \#Br√ºfeed
