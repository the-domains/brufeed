Went on a \#brewhike today at \#PointLobos State Reserve in \#Carmel with some local \#centralcoast \#craftbeers. This @FirestoneWalker \#EasyJackIPA met its match with Chief \#CanInHandMan @Nevo08 and the \#beautiful \#Californian \#coast. Here at the \#Br√ºfeed we love a good \#sessionIPA and this \#EasyJack didn't disappoint with its \#globally sourced \#hops and unmatched \#drinkability. This is a great \#IPA. \#Cheers!
