The \#Southwest Series continues with the \#Brüfeed \#SrSetUpMan JesseGDaniel and a \#GhostRiderWhiteIPA from \#ParkCity \#Utah \#brewer \#WasatchBeers. \#Legend has it that this cold \#craftbrew is named after a \#GhostRider that would \#wander the \#WasatchRange from \#LonePeak to \#NorthTimpanogos seeking \#revenge. Mission accomplished old friend, for the best revenge is \#goodbeer. Cheers from \#CanyonCountry, \#Arizona.

Back with the 3rd installment of the \#Brüfeed \#Southwest Series here at \#SquawPeak in \#Pheonix, \#Arizona with \#Chief \#CanInHandMan \#Nevo08\. This \#golden \#Pilsner by \#NewMexico's \#MarbleBrewery proved the ultimate \#trail companion with it's crisp and balanced \#hopforward solid zest. This is a highly enjoyable \#craftbrew from the \#LandOfEnchantment that is definitely worth sharing.

Starting from the \#SouthRim of the \#GrandCanyon, the \#SouthKaibabTrail leads out to \#SkeletonPoint where you can find \#360° views of the \#canyon and \#ColoradoRiver below. A good rule of thumb for a \#dayhike into the canyon is that for every 1-hour you descend, it's gonna be a more grueling two hour \#hike back up. Having enough food and water is your first priority, along with sunscreen and a fine \#craftbeer. Senior \#CanInHandMan \#nevo08 made the right choice here with \#LumberyardBrew's \#RedAle from \#Flagstaff, \#Arizona in the 4th part of this \#Brüfeed \#Southwest series. Luckily there were a few more \#coldbeers on hand for \#sunset when the vivid colors of \#thecanyon come alive in a choreographed display of dancing light and shadow. Welcome to The Canyon.

Cuttin 'em out and ridin 'em in with our \#BrewWithAView \#SrSetUpMan \#JesseGDaniel and this, the 5th installment of the \#Brüfeed \#SouthwestSeries. Live here at the \#GranCañón with a \#BarrioBrewing \#BarrioBlonde Ale from \#Tucson, \#Arizona. Sometimes you're looking for any excuse, sometimes you got one. Move 'em on, head 'em up, \#Rawhide.

On the last part of the \#journey with a \#BarrioRojo \#lowhop \#highmalt \#ScottishAle. When in \#Arizona we do as the \#Southwesterners do and \#drink the \#localbrew, and this \#BarrioBrewing \#microcervecería is a good one. \#Brüfeed \#SrSetUpMan \#JesseGDaniel finished off our \#SerieSuroeste with this great \#coldbeer against of perfect \#sky of \#noclouds. The heat was hot and the ground was dry, but the air was full of sound. \#America
