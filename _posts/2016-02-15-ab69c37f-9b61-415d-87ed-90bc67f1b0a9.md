Here in \#SF with an @AndersonValleyBrewing \#BloodOrangeGose. A fitting beer for the \#GoldenGateBridge's deep \#internationalorange, a color that moves and molds with the moods of \#thebridge. \#Brewed with \#cilantro and \#seasalt, this light citrusy sessionable \#wheatale is the perfect \#beer for a warm \#sunny day in \#TheCity. \#MarkTwain once wrote "The coldest \#winter I ever spent was a \#summer in \#SanFrancisco," Chief \#Br√ºfeed Contributor \#SrSetUpMan @JesseGDaniel musta lucked out with this then.
