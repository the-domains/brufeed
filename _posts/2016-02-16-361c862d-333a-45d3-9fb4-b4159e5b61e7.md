A \#Japanese \#boilermaker here for ya at \#InokashiraPark with the \#YokohamaBay and \#skyline in the background. That's a \#Hibiki17 \#SuntoryWhisky, an elegant oaky and \#velvety blend that is perfectly \#laidback, alongside a \#ShigaKogen \#HouseIPA. \#TamamuraHonten \#brews up some excellent \#craftbeers from the \#ricefields of \#Nagano Prefecture, and this big aroma \#IPA doesn't disappoint either. Lots of bitter good \#hoppy citrics with a crisp and balanced finish. \#Br√ºfeed
